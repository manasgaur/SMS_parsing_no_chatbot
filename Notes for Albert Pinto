Training Corpus : 5574 labeled SMS corpus
Feature Vector Generation : TfIDFvectorizer, CountVectorizer
Labels: Suspicious or Correct

________________________________
	Testing of the Machine learning Model

--- New Dataset : SMS from the Albert Pinto
--- Create a Feature Vector using the above mentioned technique
--- Pass the feature vector to the model
--- Generate the expected label

Possible Deliverable targeting :

Basic Statistics of the messages : Quartiles, Number of messages in each category
Pipeline, Model and evaluation 
The trained model will be stored and will be provided as function to be used. If the new data comes in then the model will be trained and tested again. 

Pipeline : 
Data Preprocessing 
---Tokenization, 
---lemmatization (is possible or needed)
--- Tagging (part of speech) ( lets see what we get from this)
Note : we will not perform stopwords removal and punctuation removal ( I think these are centric to text. But let me discuss).

Data Vectors 

--- Since the machine learning can never be trained on the textual data, it has to be converted to numbers.
--- In this step we will perform CountVectorizer ( frequency based) and Tf-idf measure to generate vector values for each text.
result will be (5574, 8874)
